## ðŸš© Challenge 1 â€“ KPI-Based Anomaly Detection

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Detect anomalies in Orange KPIs using a supervised machine learning approach.

### ðŸ§  Methodology
- We used the **XGBoost classifier**, known for its performance on structured data.
- KPI data was **preprocessed** by filling missing values and applying **standard scaling**.
- The model was evaluated using the **Hamming Loss**, which penalizes multi-label misclassification.
- After training, the model was exported for use in downstream tasks.

## ðŸ¤– Challenge 2 â€“ LLM-Based Diagnostic Suggestions

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Provide corrective recommendations based on KPI values and anomaly detection results.

### ðŸ§  Methodology
- We used **Facebook's BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)** model via the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- KPI test data was first processed and passed through the trained **XGBoost model** to detect anomalies.
- Based on the anomaly status and KPI features, we generated **optimized prompts** to query the LLM.
- The **BART model** produced concise and relevant **diagnostic suggestions** tailored to each anomaly scenario.
